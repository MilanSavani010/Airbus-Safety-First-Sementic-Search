This is positive for the industry, but we also must acknowledge the challenge of our air transport system to cope with the need to increase capacity. This is true for operators and manufacturers alike and requires extra vigilance to avoid increasing the risk of a fatal accident linked to this growth. When the air transport system, its existing infrastructure and supply chain are stretched, more than ever, collaboration with all actors across the air transport system is key to ensure that our safety values are maintained. It is a continuous challenge to retain existing skills, attracting more people to work in aviation, and to train them. It can begin with a reminder of the basics, including lessons"

A limited number of people including some cabin crew members were on board. The aircraft was climbing toward its target altitude. At 10 000 ft, one of the cabin crew noticed an excessive amount of cabin noise and cold temperature while walking toward the empty middle part of the aircraft. He discovered that one of the windows on the left side of the cabin appeared to have slipped down from its usual position and that the window seal was flapping in the outside airflow fig.1 . He immediately informed the flight crew who decided to descend to 9 000 ft and to perform an inflight turnback. The aircraft landed safely and without further incident. When on the ground and with the aircraft parked, the flight crew performed an inspection of the aircraft exterior."

This type of lighting device emits a large amount of thermal energy. Only use low energy lighting devices, such as LED lights, which provide good lighting capabilities with low heat emission.

Safety first 38 July 2024 033 The LOSS OF BRAKING procedure was introduced to cover an extremely rare failure of the automatic switching to the alternate emergency braking mode, in cases where the normal braking mode failed. It must only be applied during manual braking, and only if the flight crew does not feel any effect on the deceleration while pressing on the brake pedals. To prevent inappropriate application of the LOSS OF BRAKING PROCEDURE, flight crew should be aware that, on contaminated runways, the perceived rate of deceleration may be lower than the rate"

Flight crew should also be aware that an uneven contamination of the runway, or the presence of standing water in some areas of the runway after a heavy rainfall, may cause sudden changes in the deceleration rate. This could cause the flight crew to incorrectly determine they have a total loss of braking. Flight crew should also be prepared for the sudden change in the perceived rate of deceleration when they transition from REV MAX to REV IDLE, especially on wet or contaminated runways, since the braking efficiency is reduced. It is essential to discuss these effects during the arrival briefing so that the flight crew will not be surprised should they perceive a sudden change in the rate of deceleration during the landing roll.

In addition, various operational constraints such as supply chain disruption affecting parts availability or the lack of qualified maintenance personnel may make it difficult to repair or replace the equipment within the time frame allowed by the MEL. This leads to an increase of the number of aircraft dispatched with open MEL items and therefore an increased exposure to multiple failure situations as described in the case study.

    "text": "OPERATIONS Engine Relight After an AllEngine Flameout Engine Relight After an AllEngine Flameout An allengine flameout is one of the most stressful situations where flight crews need to urgently relight the aircraft engines. Incorrect application of the engine relight sequence can lead to delayed or unsuccessful engine restarts. This article describes an inservice event in which such a situation was encountered. It recalls the various steps of the engine relight sequence in the ALL ENG FAIL procedure of the QRH and highlights the improvements that have been made on the operational procedure of A300, A310, A320 family, A330, A340, A350 and A380 aircraft."

Due to adverse weather conditions, the flight crew decided to divert to an alternate airport, where they performed a safe landing at 1840 local time. After a threehour stopover, the aircraft departed the diversion airport at 2151 local time, heading towards its initial destination. Weather avoidance and storm encounter During the night flight, persistent adverse weather remained along their route. 1 The flight crew requested a northward deviation to avoid storm cells that they detected on their weather radar. 2 The aircraft was cruising at FL 240 with autopilot and autothrust ON when the flight crew executed a 90 left turn toward their final destination.
