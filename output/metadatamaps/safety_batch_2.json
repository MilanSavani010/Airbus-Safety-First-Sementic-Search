    "text": "editorial A Tribute to Bernard Ziegler In each era of aviation, there are people who pioneer an idea with such conviction that the industry as a whole will benefit from it. Working for Bernard Ziegler a.k.a BZ as he was called by all who knew him, I witnessed firsthand his passion for flight, his relentless innovative spirit, and the power of his convictions. The most visible legacy from BZ is certainly the benefits of flight envelope protection enabled by FlyByWire FBW technology on commercial jet aircraft. BZ believed that this step change would significantly reduce the risk of loss of control inflight. The FBW technology was thus first introduced on the Airbus A320 and it is the baseline for every Airbus aircraft produced since. Beyond the Airbus fleet, it is the industry standard today for all new aircraft types. The facts demonstrate BZs vision was absolutely correct, that FBW would"

Indeed, aircraft with flight envelope protection enabled by FBW technology that belong to the current fourth generation of commercial jets have an impressive record. Today there are around 15,500 in operation, with 11,600 or 75 of which are Airbus FBW aircraft. Fourthgeneration aircraft have completed more than 212 million flights and accumulated over 500 million flight hours 172 million flights and 375 million flight hours by Airbus aircraft over the last 33 years. This has resulted in a historically low rate of 0.04 fatal accidents per million flights 10year moving average compared with the rate of 0.15 for the previous thirdgeneration aircraft without FBW. To follow on from BZs focus on the reduction of accidents caused by loss of control inflight LOCI, the current LOCI accident rate 0.01 for fourthgeneration jets is a sevenfold decrease when compared with the rate of 0.07 LOCI accidents"

More than thirty years on, we can reflect on the occasions when persistence over the resistance to change required the characteristic tenacity of someone like BZ, to win over the sceptics and gain support for his vision. The foundations for aviation to make a leap forward in safety are often laid by such visionaries. It is then our duty to constantly reinforce their legacy through collaboration across our industry, and through the implementation of incremental safety improvements on our aircraft and for how they are operated.

Between January 2020 and March 2021, 55 events of unreliable airspeed indication during takeoff were reported to Airbus. Majority of events linked to Pitot obstruction 44 of the 55 reported cases of unreliable airspeed at takeoff were due to obstruction of the Pitot tube. Obstructions can be caused by the presence of insects, sand, dirt, dust or any other foreign materials that could enter the Pitot when protective covers are not fitted to the aircraft when on the ground. In one reported case, the obstruction was because the protective covers were not removed before the flight."

In the meantime, the ground personnel observed that the right main landing gear wheel was on fire and extinguished it using a fire extinguisher at the gate. Event Analysis The investigation showed that the head of one of the tie bolts of wheel n3 had sheared off and progressively migrated toward the brake, causing damage to the brake assembly during the previous flights. This damage eventually caused a leak from the green hydraulic system, which triggered the ECAM messages that indicated low hydraulic system pressure and low fluid levels during the flight. The leak from the yellow hydraulic system happened when the parking brake was set to ON at the gate, causing hydraulic fluid to be in contact with the hot brakes and resulting in the wheel fire.

A system reset is the action of switching off a system and then switching it back on again with the objective to retrieve normal system behavior or recover a previously lost function. It is different from reengaging a tripped Circuit Breaker CB. Automatic Reset vs. Manual Reset Certain avionic systems, such as the Flight Management System FMS, have an automatic reset function. The reset action is completely managed by the system that has an automatic failure detection mode. Maintenance or fl ight crews perform a manual reset by using the cockpit control for the system, a circuit breaker, or a dedicated reset button also called a reset switch. This article focuses only on these types of manual resets. Manual Reset Using System Controls For specifi c"

The traditional CB is manually opened and closed. The electronic CB, also called Solid State Power Controller SSPC, is controlled by a remote interface on A220A380 A350. Various system CBs are located in the cockpit of Airbus A220A300 A310A320 aircraft, the avionics bay, the cabin, and the cargo compartments.

Inappropriate system resets can have serious consequences Past events have highlighted how some system resets can have irreversible consequences. One example is where a system cannot be recovered after an inappropriate system reset in flight. Another example is where a reset of flight control computers is unduly performed. Depending on the system malfunction encountered, this can cause unexpected movements of the flight control surfaces, which may lead to serious consequences if performed in flight. Avionics systems are interconnected systems, therefore, a system reset of one system can have significant consequences for the other systems that rely on its data.

The industry as a whole has certainly been tested, and it was a huge test. However, we can now observe some positive signs of recovery, even if the world is not yet free of this crisis. On the safety front, I am sure that everyone will agree that we have all been able to navigate through this crisis thanks to our collective resilience, which relies on our shared safety values. Reinforcing this resilience has remained a focus for all of us, from OEMs, suppliers, operators, authorities and aviation organisations. We need to maintain this focus to help address the challenges that lay ahead of us. Challenges such as getting out of"

TCAP PREVENTS RAs The TCAP function is an improved ALT altitude capture law for flight guidance computers.

What is resilience? The term resilience has become widely used in recent years, and not only in aviation. Resilience is used to qualify and evaluate human performance when faced with unexpected disruptions in operation.

CASE 5 180 TURN WITH NLG INOPERATIVE BEFORE TAKEOFF Event description In March 2021, an A320 family aircraft was dispatched with the NWS inoperative MEL item 325101 Nose Wheel Steering Control System. This was due to a failure detected by the BSCU. The WHEEL NW STRG FAULT ECAM alert was triggered during engine start as expected for the dispatch under the MEL. The MEL operational procedure states that the flight crew must avoid sharp turns when the NWS is inoperative."

    "text": "OPERATIONS Landing with Nosewheels at 90 degrees Prevention There were very few cases of dispatch with inoperative NWS on A320 family aircraft reported to Airbus over the last 15 years. Dispatching an aircraft with an inoperative NWS requires operational precautions that are explained in the associated operational procedure. Even if the safety analysis shows that an acceptable level of safety is granted when dispatching the aircraft without an operative NWS system, the operational burden is significant. For that reason, and to avoid such an event occuring again, the Nose Wheel Steering Item 325101 will be removed from the MMEL. It will no longer be possible to dispatch an aircraft with an inoperative NWS system. The updated Master MEL MMEL revision will be available in February 2022. An FOT will also be published to further explain the rationale for removing this MMEL item and to provide appropriate mitigation means in the"

Based on inservice experience and the design of the A300A310 NLG, the wheels are not likely to turn at 90. Operational considerations The A320 FCOM mentions the possibility of having NLG wheels at 90 when both the WHEEL NW STRG FAULT and LG SHOCK ABSORBER FAULT ECAM alerts are triggered and recommends delaying the nosewheel touchdown at landing."

There were no serious injuries or fatalities and the damage caused to the nose gears on these aircraft was repairable. Actions were taken to prevent recurrence of each event. Updated Brake System Control Unit BSCU standards were developed and retrofitted. Improved design for the upper support of the NLG shock absorber was deployed on the A320 family fleet.

If the flight crew performs a reset that is not listed in this table it could lead to unintended and serious incidents. The latest action taken is to prevent the dispatch of an aircraft with the NWS system inoperative in order to avoid the risk of having the nosewheels at 90."
