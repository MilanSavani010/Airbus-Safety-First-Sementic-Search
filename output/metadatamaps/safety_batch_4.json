    "text": "YANNICK MALINGE SVP Chief Product Safety Officer editorial Dear Aviation Colleagues, The rate of accidents for commercial jet transport remains relatively stable today. A very slight increase of the accident rate for the fourth generation of commercial jets was recorded in 2022 due to two events with fatal injuries to four people in ground vehicles that entered an operational runway. It shows that, even though the commercial air transport system has significantly improved its safety record over the years, we all need to be permanently vigilant and to avoid any increase in the accident rate. Another warning sign is the reported number of recent close call runway incursions, requiring all of us to reinforce the safety barriers to prevent an accident. We all welcome the returning demand for flights. It also comes with its inherent risk exposure. Especially when this is coupled with the departure of experienced aviation professionals across"

In such cases, reporting these events is essential to better understand the cockpit conditions and human factors involved. This allows for the immediate actions such as raising awareness and increasing the flight crews vigilance to detect these potential problems. Reported events also provide data needed for analysis and development of possible enhancements that can further increase the resilience of the aircrafts systems. This is why the importance of reporting will be a topic in focus at our upcoming 28 th Airbus Annual Flight Safety Conference. Airline speakers will provide testimony about how they empower and encourage their flight, cabin, and maintenance crews to speak up and report events, even for an incident when there were no operational consequences.

This human ability for pattern seeking and automatically performing actions allows us to preserve our brains cognitive resources, making it possible to focus on something else when performing routine actions. For example, flight crews can often perform instantaneous monitoring of the aircraft in normal flight conditions whilst communicating with air traffic control. SkillBased Errors Behaviors based on routines, or socalled skillbased behaviors, are when humans perform automatic actions with low conscious control on how they are performing them. According to aviation human factors expert, James Reason, there are two types of skillbased errors Lapses when an action is missed Slips when an action is performed incorrectly Reason, James.

This is why cockpit control confusion is more often observed with experienced pilots performing wellknown procedures. Human Factors Other contributing factors for slips are fatigue, overconfidence, and momentary distractions such as pilot preoccupation or an unexpected interruption when performing a wellknown sequence of actions or a flow pattern. Anticipation of the action is also a contributing factor. For example, when a pilot habitually rests their hand on the control before activating it, this indicates that the pilots mind is already committed to performing the next action with that control even if a different control action is called for. This can result in the inadvertent use of that cockpit control. Shape Position of the Controls There are reported cases of confusion between the expedite EXPED pushbutton and"

Changing the design of a cockpit control that is very familiar to many thousands of pilots can be counterintuitive, and it is not possible to cover all cockpit control confusion cases. The Importance of Reporting The aircraft systems are very resilient to inadvertent use of cockpit controls, pilots will react quickly to correct their error, and there is often no operational consequence. It may not seem necessary for the flight crew to report the cockpit control confusion incident, but it is important to better understand the contributing factors and identify the possible mitigations.

Some operators have reinforced this by creating additional callouts for their flight crews when carrying out routine tasks in the cockpit. Recognized best practices are described in the Flight Crew Techniques Manual FCTM of all Airbus aircraft A300600, A310, A320 Family, A330A340 Family, A380, A350, A220 in the Cockpit Philosophy chapter. The main recommendations for flight crews are Do not rest your hands on controls. Do not anticipate actions by putting your hands on the controls before you need to. Perform a visual check on the control before using it. Even if you are focused on the PFD you should look at the controls before using them. Check the result of the action, which is essential.

Examples of additional callouts from an Operator During the Engine Start procedure, the PF points to the ENG MODE selector and calls ENG MODE SELECTOR before using it. Before using the flaps, the PM puts their hand on the lever and calls out Flaps before moving the lever and calling out the flap position. Before using the landing gear, the PM puts their hand on the lever and calls out Gear before moving the lever and calling out Up or Down. These additional callouts reduced the number of inadvertent uses of the parking brake handle instead of the ENG MODE selector, and the inadvertent flaps selection or landing gear selection, by increasing the attentional focus of the flight crew.

For example, Airbus hosts a Lightning Strikes Expert Forum in order to exchange experience about managing lightning strikes with all operators. An SRM working group except A220 also meets regularly since 2014 to exchange experience about structural repair topics. INFORMATION Further information can be found in the AMMMP, SRMASRASRP documents available on the AirbusWorld portal and in the following published documents OIT 999.006615 OIT 999.000320 ATA 51 STRUCTURAL REPAIR MANUALS AND AIRCRAFT STRUCTURAL REPAIR MANUALS CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS Safety"

Aircraft manufacturers must demonstrate that their aircraft remain safe after a lightning strike. Flight crews should avoid areas with lightning conditions as much as possible by using weather forecasts, onboard weather radar, and ATC guidance. When an aircraft is parked or stored outside in lightning conditions, it is important to apply precautionary measures such as electrically grounding the aircraft, pausing ground or maintenance operations, and disconnecting any"

It is also important that all operators are familiar with the local airport regulations and procedures for severe storms and lightning events, and have their own policies in place for their flight crews, maintenance crews, and ground crews. For every lightning strike event, it is essential for flight crews to make an accurate logbook entry and for maintenance crews to adhere to the AMMMPAMP procedures to perform inspection and damage assessment. Any repair must be done using the SRM ASR on A350 and ASRP on A220. Operators should report all their lightning strike events to Airbus, even if there is no damage found in the post lightning strike inspection. This will provide data that contributes to further enhancing industry knowledge on the subject."

In both cases, the inappropriate VS target resulted in a pitch down command of the autopilot with high thrust. The flight guidance used the previously selected VS value set during the preceding ILS glide slope intercept from above as a VS target for the mode reversion. This article describes one of these events in detail and explains the conditions that caused this autoflight behavior. It provides operational recommendations to flight crews to prevent and detect this situation. It also lists the system enhancements that were launched to avoid the use of an inappropriate VS or FPA target during a mode reversion of the flight guidance.

This triggered a reversion to the VS mode as per flight guidance logic. Since the VS value was modified shortly before the goaround, it was still in the memory and displayed on the FCU.
