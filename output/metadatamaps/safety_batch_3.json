However, the global safety record over this period has shown a high level of resilience thanks to robust safety governance and safety culture. This has demonstrated the added value of the safety management systems that were implemented and continuously reinforced across the industry. The same challenges remain for the return to service and rampup of operations in the recovery phase. In addition to this, there is a significant number of people who have left the industry, meaning we must now attract and engage a new generation of aviation professionals. It is also an opportunity to reinject the right safety culture for everyone working across the air transport system. A"

Even if EGT overlimit events are common, they can increase the flight crew workload in a critical phase of flight, especially when they happen on both engines simultaneously. They can create operational disruptions e.g. rejected takeoff or inflight turnback and require maintenance actions. CASE STUDY Event Description An A321 aircraft, with a takeoff weight of 73 T MTOW 98.7 T, was in CONF2 with packs ON and ready for takeoff on a relatively warm weather day 30C OATISA15. The flight crew applied standard thrust stabilization and then TOGA thrust. The takeoff was uneventful until liftoff. At 90 ft RA, the ENG1 EGT OVER LIMIT and ENG2 EGT OVER LIMIT ECAM alerts triggered. The PF initially moved both thrust levers to MCT, then engaged the autopilot at 450"

The flight crew started the APU and began descent to initiate the approach. The ENG1 master switch was set back to ON during the descent and Engine 1 successfully restarted at approximately 2 700 ft. The approach and landing were performed without any further events. Event Analysis The investigation confirmed that both engines had an EGT overlimit and compressor stall during the event.

Maintenance should also request that Flight Operations plan for, and ask flight crews to perform, regular TOGA thrust takeoffs to ensure efficient monitoring of the EGT margin of the engines. Flight Operations should avoid scheduling performancelimited aircraft on demanding routes and inform flight crews before they fly on a performancelimited aircraft, so that they can adapt their procedures accordingly.

This lower limit for acid levels of 1.0 mg KOHg was determined using inservice data analysis. This showed that when the results from the analysis of hydraulic fluid samples had a TAN value between 1.0 and 1.5 mg KOHg, the very next sample taken was likely to show a significant increase of acid levels. Performing corrective actions from 1.0 mg KOHg will further prevent reaching high acidity values and this will improve the reliability of hydraulic components."

Timely application of the engine fire procedure will limit fire propagation and prevent further damage to components or pipes around the engine core.

It can be seen as deposits, which vary in color from translucent to dark, with a viscosity that ranges from oily gel to solid. Microorganisms need a food source, water, and warm temperatures to grow. A fuel tank provides the perfect conditions for microorganisms to develop, because they feed on the fuel hydrocarbons, and water is always present in a fuel tank. This water comes from two main sources dissolved water in uplifted fuel and condensation due to vent air, which enters the fuel tank during normal operations, especially during descent from dry, cold air in cruise to warmer wetter air at lower altitudes. This is the reason why the risk of contamination from microorganisms increases in locations with hot and humid weather conditions.

Even with this recovery target in sight, people from across the air transport system remain focussed on raising the bar for safety. A focus during the period of massive fleet grounding was to ensure the parked aircraft could return to service airworthy and safe. To face the rampup to recovery, it was necessary to go the extra mile for safety together. As a manufacturer, we worked to ensure continuity was maintained with our partners and suppliers. Operators managed recurrent training of pilots, cabin crews, and maintenance crews. The same efforts extended to air traffic controllers, dispatchers, ground crews, and everyone working for a"

The public appetite for travel, following the relaxation of restrictions, created a rapid rampup in the demand for flights. This causes an increased risk exposure that is similar to the effects of the accelerated industry growth observed from the early 2000s. We worked together to significantly reduce the accident rate throughout this growth period by taking safety beyond compliance, managing risks, and implementing sound safety governance. Even if the accident rate remains very low today, we cannot afford to be complacent. It is our call to action to redouble these efforts and to continuously enhance the safety of a flight, because we all expect zero accidents when we fly. In facing these challenges together, I sincerely wish everyone successful and safe flying"

When carbon oxidation is due to the presence of catalysts, it is usually referred to as catalytic oxidation. Thermal oxidation Thermal oxidation is the main cause of accelerated degradation of carbon brakes. It can occur if high brake temperatures are reached after landing and during taxi. Thermal oxidation affects all brake disks, but the middle disks are most affected because they reach a higher temperature and take longer to cool down. Worn brakes tend to reach higher temperatures making them more prone to the effects of thermal oxidation.

It is important to perform a careful visual inspection of the brake assembly at every wheel removal to check for signs of excessive oxidation. Operators should consider adding the optional inspection check developed with the brake manufacturers into their AMMMP. Flight crews can apply a number of recommended procedures and techniques to help reduce the rates of brake wear and oxidation. This includes reducing the number of brake applications during taxi, applying techniques that will reduce braking energy at landing, and using brake fans when available.

Refer to the recommendation to lubricate at a higher frequency in TFU 32.11.13.024. Injecting the Right Quantity of Grease The grease is injected through the grease nipples, using an electrical or manual grease pump.

Therefore, cases of excessive quantities of grease occurred, which led to the malfunction of the uplock hook and the triggering of the LG NOT UPLOCKED ECAM alert for the flight crew with associated operational consequences."

During the servicing task, the Pressure Regulator Transmitter PRT between the oxygen servicing cart and the crew oxygen cylinder exploded and started a fire that propagated towards the oxygen cylinder. The fire at the PRT melted the inlet hose of the cylinder valve, which caused it to separate from the PRT.

It triggered the ignition of an Oring inside the PRT and the fire propagated to the cylinder valve. The maintenance crew then opened the CHARGESTOP valve set to the CHARGE position. This created a rapid pressurization inside the flexible filling line up to 1 600 psi, which caused the oxygen temperature to increase to approximately 800C at the entry of the PRT. This phenomenon is called adiabatic compression. An Oring located at the PRT inlet ignited at this temperature.

When pressurizing an oxygen system or device, it is essential to always slowly open the valves and to control the slow pressurization of the system. OXYGEN AND THE RISK OF FIRE Oxygen is not a flammable gas but an excellent oxidizer, which is present at a concentration of approximately 21 in the ambient air. It is odorless, invisible, and difficult to detect.
