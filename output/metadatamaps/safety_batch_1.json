All actors in commercial air transport redoubled efforts to promote the relevant guidance materials for the massive task of parking and storing aircraft, and subsequently supporting Operators to prepare for a safe return to the skies. This showed that our industrys wellestablished procedures provide the necessary safeguards for maintaining safe aircraft and operating safe fl ights, especially during this particular period. With this spirit, the articles in this edition highlight some key safety considerations and provide references to the relevant publications already shared with Operators of the Airbus fl eet worldwide.

The _Mind the OEBs_ article prompts pilots to check if there are OEBs applicable to their aircraft when preparing for a fl ight, and to make sure that they are familiar with their application conditions. It is also an opportunity, when aircraft are not at peak utilisation, to encourage Operators to limit the number of applicable OEBs on their aircraft by installing OEB cancellation modifi cations as soon as possible. The _Safe Aircraft Refuelling_ article shares why safety precautions and procedures must be strictly followed when refuelling an aircraft, which requires close coordination between the ground crew, the fl ight crew and cabin crew. With so many aircraft grounded, some adaptation is required, but it is best to avoid using improvised or unapproved items to protect the aircraft and its components.

However, if the expected winds are above the aircrafts stability limits, Airbus recommends to move the aircraft to another airport when possible. On A220 aircraft, similar safety precautions should be followed as recommended above. In addition, the Flight By Wire architecture being susceptible to high winds, it is important to be aware of the Parking and mooring gust limits provided in AMP BD500AJ10200002AAA030AA."

Protecting air data probes Air Data probes need to be protected to prevent dust or insects from causing an obstruction. Approved probe covers must be used. They can normally be found in each aircrafts flyaway kit. Some precautions must be taken when using alternative means like plastic foil when the approved covers are unavailable. These materials can damage the probes. For example, using plastic foil to cover the angleofattack probes can cause water to ingress inside the probe when water accumulates inside the plastic foil if the foil is not properly sealed with the fuselage and not equipped with drain holes. This can result in a blocked probe in flight when the aircraft"

The PF initiated a goaround by setting TOGA thrust and applying a full nose up command. There was a tail strike as the aircraft lifted off from the runway at 133 kt.

Knowing that an unstable approach is still a contributing factor to many accidents or incidents during approach and landing, it is why repeating and sharing the lessons learned can ensure the flight crew is well prepared to ensure a safe landing. Flight crews should anticipate scenarios that can happen during descent and approach during their approach briefing, such as late changes requested by ATC. The aircrafts energy can then be efficiently managed by using the available tools and techniques provided in Airbus documentation. This will also enable the flight crew to identify any possibility of an unstable approach as soon as possible, allowing for early intervention to either recover the situation or to interrupt the approach.

Flight crews should alert ATC when they are not able to comply with a request, and if necessary, ask for additional track miles to manage the aircrafts energy. Operators should promote strict adherence to stabilization criteria with flight crews and to consider the stabilization height as a hard decision gate that should not be passed if any of the stabilization criteria is not met. A nonpunitive policy regarding goaround should apply together with appropriate training for goaround in various situations. This will increase the confidence and competencies of the flight crews to discontinue the approach or perform a safe goaround at the appropriate time in the case or with the risk of an unstable approach."
